I love the way the story displays how there is no \"just bouncing back\" from being sexually assaulted.  Mia showed us how those demons come for you every day and how sometimes they best you. I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.

      "Unfortunately, much of what is written in this book is incorrect. It was Operation Red Wings, not Operation Redwing. It was always a Marine operation and the SEALs were just a small part of the larger operation. The opposing force which killed 3 of the 4 SEALs was estimated to be approximately 35 by three different investigative groups, including one group who surveyed the actual site of the firefight, and not the 80-200 claimed in the book. And there never was a vote to determine if the SEALs would kill or not kill the civilians.Only a few of the reviewers seemed to focus on the biggest issue&#8230; which was the poor decision-making of the SEAL team after encountering the three goatherds. Being discovered by those goatherds is what is called a &#8220;soft contact&#8221; or a &#8220;soft compromise.&#8221; It should have been an immediate reason for terminating the mission. That the team waited around for another 90 minutes (according to the author &#8211; which could also be an untruth) and was still attempting to conduct the mission, was a huge mistake. The mission had been compromised and should have been immediately aborted.The other issue that is not even mentioned is the strong possibility that the opposing Taliban force had known about the SEALs insertion from their own reconnaissance and not told anything by the goatherds.One of the things that most upset me in reading this story was Luttrell&#8217;s constant bashing of the so-called &#8220;liberal media&#8221; and his frustration in &#8220;having to conform his behavior to the ROE (rules of engagement).&#8221; That is such an ignorant copout. It&#8217;s the military, not civilians, who created the ROE, and those rules make perfect sense when you study them and understand their intent. Any intelligent soldier would understand this&#8230; and Luttrell tries to tell us that SEALs are very smart. Apparently, Luttrell is the exception.After sifting through the truth about the mission and the misinformation provided in this book, here&#8217;s where I finally arrived at:&#9679;  The Taliban knew the SEALs recon team had landed. It was their mountain and they would have had their own scouts keeping an eye out. The odds were low that their position had been given up by the goatherds.&#9679;  The SEALs knowingly took up a position that was not the high ground, which was inherently dangerous.&#9679;  The Taliban got to the SEALs&#8217; hinding place fairly quickly and had the high ground, which put the SEALs in the weaker position.&#9679;  An opposing force of 3:1 is defendable but only if the lower-numbered force has a defendable position. The SEALs (4) were up against an opposing force of approx. 35, which is an 8:1 ratio, which is not survivable even if the SEALs held a defendable position. But in this case, the Taliban not only had an 8:1 advantage, they also held the high ground. Net-net: the four SEALs were in an unsurvivable position. It was a minor miracle that one of them survived.&#9679;  It was not the &#8220;liberal media&#8221; or the Rules of Engagement that led to the deaths of those three SEALs. They were in a war zone against a competent opponent. They caught a bit of bad luck when the goatherds crossed paths with them, but rather than instantly abort the mission as soon as they had been soft compromised (which is what they should have done), they remained in the area, which gave the Taliban forces the time needed to find them and attack.\n",
